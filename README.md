# Client-Server-Communication-Program

Project Overview
This project implements a TCP client-server application in Java. The client sends a character and a string to the server, which processes the inputs by counting the occurrences of the character in the string. The server then returns the count to the client. The system supports case-insensitive matching by converting both the input string and the character to lowercase before processing.

# Key Features

-TCP Communication: Demonstrates basic TCP socket programming for client-server interaction.

-Case-Insensitive Matching: Ensures accurate character counting regardless of case.

-Input Validation: Includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

-Modular Design: Separates client and server logic for clarity and maintainability.

Learning Outcomes
This project provides hands-on experience with:

-TCP/IP communication protocols.

-Client-server architecture.

-Socket programming in Java.

-Input validation and error handling.

Usage

-Clone the repository.

-Compile and run the server application.

-Compile and run the client application.

-Follow the prompts to input a character and a string.

-View the server's response with the character count.
